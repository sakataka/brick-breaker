# Idea Progress Template

Use this table in `docs/idea-progress.md`.

| ID | Idea | Priority | Status | Started | Finished | Commit | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BB-IDEA-01 | ステージ目標ミッション | P1 | TODO | - | - | - | - |

Status values:
- `TODO`: not started
- `IN_PROGRESS`: currently implementing
- `DONE`: merged/committed and verified
- `BLOCKED`: waiting for decision or dependency

Update rules:
1. Mark target idea as `IN_PROGRESS` before coding.
2. Mark as `DONE` with commit hash after tests pass.
3. Keep history in Notes when requirements change.
